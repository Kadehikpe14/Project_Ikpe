      <h2>Day at Six Flags America!</h2>
      <h5>Six Flags, Bowie, MD, August, 2017</h5>
      <div class="six-flags" style="height:350px;"></div>
      <p>My first time at six flags...</p>
      <p>It was my first time going to six flags with my family, and it was a fun experience. Our first ride there was the Joker. When we first went up the stairs to ride the rollercoaster we saw them zoom and me and my sisters were so scared! The person controlling the ride told us it was going at 60 miles per hour! I was shocked but we went on the ride so scared but at the end had fun. There was so many fun rides that day but the worst thing was when we had to leave because my mom had homework to do.</p>

      <h5>My Permit Test</h5>
      <div class="permit" style="height:300px;"></div>
      <p>The day I passed my permit test...</p>
      <p>I was studying for months and months to get ready for my permit exam. My friend, Katlynn, was a few months older than me and she took her permit test way before me and I wanted to get my permit so badly. So I got the Driver's Manual and started taking notes and studying for it. When I got there i was so nervous because it was like my first "government exam". Luckily, I passed on my first try and it was nerve-racking because at the last question, if I got another wrong one I would of failed the test but I passes and my mom was so proud of me. Me and my mom waited almost 2 hours in all just to get my card. But at the end of the day, I was happy I got my permit even tho I had to wait another 9 months to get my provisionals license.</p>
